* **-input_format**: (string) 

Advanced Options:
* **-pathway_id**: (string, default: rp_pathway) ID of the heterologous pathway
* **-compartment_id**: (string, default: MNXC3 (i.e. cytoplasm)) ID of the SBML compartment where the heterologous pathway will be expressed in (default: MNXC3 (i.e. cytoplasm))
* **server_url**: (string, default: http://0.0.0.0:8888/REST) IP address of the REST service

## Output

* **-output**: (string) Path to the output file
